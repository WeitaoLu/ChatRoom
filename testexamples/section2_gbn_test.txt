Test1: Normal test
In this case , the first send is very lucky and no packet lost.
The second send shows the capacty to handle duplicate ACK(line 28) and the ACK3 can skip ACK2 and move the window correctly.(line33)
The sender also knows it sends all in line 17 and line 34 by indicating the moving is stoped.
However the receiver should not know because it can only know it should stop when sender sends it a close packet.
This case also shows my additional feature for multiple inputs
The third test shows time out and 
The plused test(in some old version of my gbn but should still works for the new one) shows that the final converge using long sentence should converge to p.

NODE 1111(sender, send 2 times below):(the prompts for receiver after summary may not correct(no node> because not refresh), but you can use send xxxx to send again.)
